# Student Management (jQuery)

A small web application built using **jQuery**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, where users can add, view, highlight, and delete student records.  
The UI features a responsive table that updates dynamically based on user input and actions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as part of a bootcamp homework to practice **jQuery fundamentals**, especially event handling, dynamic DOM manipulation, and simple state management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (jQuery)

## ✅ Features

- Add students by entering their name and class  
- View the full list of added students in a table  
- Delete specific students  
- Click a row to highlight/unhighlight it  
- All data is handled on the client side (in-memory)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements using jQuery  
- Dynamically creating and rendering HTML content  
- Handling form submissions and button clicks  
- Basic array manipulation and UI state updates

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

This project shows that even with older tools like jQuery, it's possible to build fast, responsive, and interactive UI components.  
It helped reinforce foundational concepts before moving on to more modern libraries.
